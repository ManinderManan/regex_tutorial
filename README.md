# Regex-Tutorial Match Email

## Description

A regular expression, or regex for short, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When incorporated into code or search algorithms, regular expressions enable the identification of particular patterns of characters within a string. Additionally, they can be utilized to locate and substitute a character or sequence of characters within a string. Furthermore, regular expressions are commonly employed for input validation purposes.
